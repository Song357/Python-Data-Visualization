# Python1
This program reads the longitude, latitude, temperatures and dates from two different CSV files (dataset) that are provided from the weather stations around the world and visualizes the locations and temperatures into an interactive map for 365 days. Attributes from both datasets correlate by matching the unique station number and aggregating the data into a world map for each day of the year. The data set is called Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD). This dataset is basically records of the daily weather measurements (temperature, wind speed, humidity, pressure, and more) from 9000+ weather stations around the world.
