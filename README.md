# This program generates weather maps
This program reads the longitude, latitude, temperatures and dates from two different CSV files (dataset) that are provided from the weather stations around the world and visualizes the locations and temperatures into an interactive map for 365 days. Attributes from both datasets correlate by matching the unique station number and aggregating the data into a world map for each day of the year. The data set is called Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD). This dataset is basically records of the daily weather measurements (temperature, wind speed, humidity, pressure, and more) from 9000+ weather stations around the world. 


NOTE:
I'm unable to provide the dataset here in github because it is very large. If you want to download the dataset please visit this link https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/noaa-gsod. You have to create an account in order to be able to download the entire dataset.
